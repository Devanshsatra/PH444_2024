        "For charges moving at constant speeds, the situation is straightforward. The forces and energy changes can be solved exactly. It's possible to change the magnetic field energy while keeping the particle speeds constant if the distance between the charges changes. In this case, the change in magnetic field energy comes from external forces, which maintain these constant speeds. There are no changes in kinetic energy or Faraday acceleration electric fields.\n",

The moving charge has an associated magnetic field, and the resulting emf matches the changing magnetic flux through the closed curve. Therefore, depending on the speed of the charge, a charge may or may not cause an emf. If we only have two charges moving at constant speeds, we can always go to the rest frame of one of the charges, leaving us with only changes in electric field energy and no changes in magnetic field energy at all.\n",

        "In conclusion, the Darwin energy expressions shed light on the energy associated with the interaction of two low-speed charges. The electric field energ we get is the familiar expression from electrostatics. However, the magnetic field energy involves not only the separations but also the velocities of the charged particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly enough, we say that charges moving at constant velocities do not experience Faraday acceleration electric fields, and any changes in magnetic field energy result from external forces maintaining the particles' velocities constant. On the other hand if the charges are accelerating, the magnetic field energy may also change due to the Faraday Acceleration terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In scenarios where the speed of current carriers varies, the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ acts as a mediator between magnetic and electric fields. Any external force that attempts to cause the charges to accelerate the current carriers produce a time varying $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ which in turn creates an induced Electric field to balance the energy change due to work done by the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The change in the magnetic field energy remains consistent with energy conservation because the external or internal agent causing the change has to do additional work against the back Faraday Electric fields."
